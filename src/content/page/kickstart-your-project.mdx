        title: What sort of tweaks can we make to the theme in 10 hours?
        description: >+
          Within that 10-hour stretch, we're delving into the design to make it
          distinctly yours. We'll whip up to 5 pages and fine-tune everything â€“
          brand colors, your logo, fonts, and page elements. Whether you're into
          snazzy square buttons or envision a hero section with a sleek,
          wave-free vibe, we've got you covered. Ultimately, the goal is for the
          site to mirror your vision.

        title: What if my project is a bigger deal?
        description: >
          If it turns out your project needs more than our initial 10-hour
          estimate, no problemo. We can turn it into a custom job. Just let us
          know what you're envisioning, and we'll crunch the numbers. We'll give
          you a breakdown of the extra hours needed and a timeline. Our goal is
          to handle your larger project with the same attention to detail,
          creating something special that goes above and beyond.

        title: " I need a cookie banner & GA4. Is this possible?"
        description: >
          Absolutely! Integrating a cookie banner along with GTM/GA4 typically
          takes around 1 hour, depending on your specific preferences. If you
          require assistance with creating custom conversions, it may take a bit
          more time, but we're here to tailor it to your needs.

        description: >

          solution. The hosting cost depends on the traffic and is typically
          around $15 USD per month.

        title: What does 10h+ mean and what do I get for it?
        description: >
          The 10+ hours signify our commitment to completing your job within the
          initial 10-hour timeframe. However, if it takes a bit more, say 15
          hours, we won't hesitate to put in the extra effort. 


          Alongside the dedicated hours, you also receive a license to remove the attribution from your website. We're here to ensure your project is not only timely but also tailored to your needs.
